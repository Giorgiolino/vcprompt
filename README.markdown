vcprompt lite
=============

This is the "lightweight" branch of vcprompt. It is intended to be
*very* small.

It will only support features which:

1. Are available across (almost) every VCS
2. Can be implemented with fairly recent versions of each VCS
3. Can be implemented without calling external binaries
4. Are actually used by someone (read: me).


Be warned: this is not in any way sideways-compatible with the master
branch. It may also disappear tomorrow or be around for all eternity.
